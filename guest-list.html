									<p>She is  married to her cousin Chester, the duke of Brecon. She has a passion for gardening, and she is an award-winning grower of English roses.</p>
									<p>She is beautiful, shy and moderate lady, supportive of her husband’s political work, even though her not really into details. (And honestly, they bore her.)Any question considering his work will be passed on to him. Dorothy only responds diplomatically, in a way that won’t offend anyone.</p>

									<h2 class="align-center">Chester, Duke of Brecon (Wales)</h2>
									<p>He comes from an old wealthy family and is married to his cousin, Dorothy, the duchess of Brecon. He is a conservative politician, and member of House of Lords. Duke of Brecon (Wales) is  candidating for the prime minister post.</p>
									<p>He is a real patriot. His conservative values spills over at anything and everything. He is the type of man who can comment on a person’s table manners in front of everyone else, and still get away with being the classy one. On the contrary, he never fail to favour and give advantages to those who pleases you. He appreciates the fair delicacy of a real lady, but he can’t really see the point of letting them into House of Parliament.</p>
									<p>Having a Christian moral and being loyal to his country is very important to him, and he likes to preach this to whomever might be listening.</p>
									<p>The elections are getting closer and he is aiming at the prime minister post. He will not let anything come in his way, so it’s crucial to keep his reputation unsoiled at any cost.</p>
									<p>He is the best friends with Lord Novartis.</p>
