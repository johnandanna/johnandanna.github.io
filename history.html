					<p>To explain the story of Ward family it is necessary to go back a little. It is necessary indeed to go back to the middle of the nineteenth century, when an industrious and intelligent man called Sibert Ward, who had been head gardener at a grand place in Sussex and had married the cook, bought with his savings and hers a few acres north of London and set up as a market gardener.</p>
					<p><img class="image left" src="/images/istra/pic1.jpg" />Though he was then forty and his wife not far from it they had eight children. He prospered, and with the money he made bought little bits of land in what was still open country. The city expanded and his market garden acquired value as a building site; with money borrowed from the bank he put up a row of villas and in a short while let them all on lease. It would be tedious to go into the details of his progress, and it is enough to say that when he died, at the age of eighty-four, the few acres he had bought to grow vegetables for Covent Garden, and the properties he had continued to acquire whenever opportunity presented, were covered with bricks and mortar.</p>
					<p>Sibert Ward took care that his children should receive the education that had been denied him. They moved up in the social scale. He made the Ward Estate, as he had somewhat grandly named it, into a private company and at his death each child received a certain number of shares as an inheritance.</p>
					<p>The Ward Estate was well managed and though it could not compare in importance with the Westminster or the Portman Estate, for its situation was modest and it had long ceased to have any value as a residential quarter, shops, warehouses, factories, slums, long rows of dingy houses in two storeys, made it sufficiently profitable to enable its proprietors, through no merit and little exertion of their own, to live like the gentlemen and ladies they were now become.</p>
					<p>Indeed, the head of the family, the only surviving child of old Sibert’s eldest son, a brother having been killed in the war and a sister by a fall in the hunting-field, was a very rich man. He was a Member of Parliament and at the time of King George the Fifth’s Jubilee had been created a baronet. He had tacked his wife’s name on to his own and was now known as Sir Wilfred Benoise -Ward. The family had hopes that his staunch allegiance to the Tory Party and the fact that he had a safe seat would result in his being raised to the peerage.</p>
					<p><img class="image right" src="/images/istra/pic2.jpg" />John Ward, youngest of Sibert’s many grandchildren, had been sent to a public school and to Cambridge. He was a man of varied interests. At this time he was in the early seventies tall, with a good figure and, with his blue eyes, fine grey hair worn rather long, and high colour, of an agreeable aspect. He looked more like a soldier or a colonial governor home on leave than a house agent and you would never have guessed that his grandfather was a gardener and his grandmother a cook. He was a good golfer, for which pastime he had ample leisure, and a good shot. But John Ward was more than a sportsman; he was keenly interested in the arts. The rest of the family had no such foibles and they looked upon John’s predilections with an amused tolerance, but when, for some reason or other, one of them wanted to buy a piece of furniture or a picture, his advice was sought and taken. It was natural enough that he should know what he was talking about, for he had married a painter’s daughter.</p>
					<p>Nicholas Benois (Benois was born in Russia, to Anna Katarina (Groppe), who was of German descent, and a French father, Louis Jules Benois ) his wife’s father, was a member of the Russian Imperial Academy of Arts and for a long time, between the ’eighties and the end of the century, had made a good income by painting pictures of young women in eighteenth-century costume dallying with young men similarly dight. He painted them in gardens of old-world flowers, in leafy bowers and in parlours furnished correctly with the chairs and tables of the period. But now when his pictures turned up at Christie’s they were sold for thirty shillings or two pounds. Elisabeth Ward had inherited quite a number when her father died, but they had long stood in a box-room, covered with dust, their faces to the wall; for at this time of day even filial affection could not persuade her that they were anything but dreadful.</p>
					<p>The John Ward were not in the least ashamed of the fact that his grandmother had been a cook, indeed with their friends they were apt to make a facetious point of it, but it embarrassed them to speak of Nicholas Benois. Some of the Ward relations still had on their walls examples of his work; they were a mortification to Elisabeth.</p>
					<p>“I see you’ve still got Father’s picture there,” she said. “Don’t you think it dates rather? Why don’t you put it in one of the spare rooms?”</p>
					<p>“My father-in-law was a very charming old man,” said John, “with beautiful manners, but I’m afraid he wasn’t a very good painter.”</p>
					<p>“Well, my governor gave a tidy sum for it. It would be absurd to put a picture that cost three hundred pounds in a spare bedroom, but if you feel like that about it, I’ll tell you what I’ll do, I’ll sell it you for a hundred and fifty.”</p>
					<p>For though in the course of three generations they had become ladies and gentlemen, the Wars had not lost their business acumen.</p>
					<p><img class="image left" src="/images/istra/pic3.jpg" />The John Ward had gone a long way in artistic appreciation since their marriage and on the walls of the handsome new house they now inhabited in Porchester Close were pictures by Wilson Steer and Augustus John, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. There was an Utrillo and a Vuillard, both bought while these masters were of moderate price, and there was a Derain, a Marquet and a Chirico. You could not enter their house, somewhat sparsely furnished, without knowing at once that they were in the movement. They seldom missed a private view and when they went to Paris made a point of going to Rosenberg’s and the dealers in the Rue de Seine to have a look at what there was to be seen; they really liked pictures and if they did not buy any before the cultured opinion of the day had agreed on their merits this was due partly to a modest lack of confidence in their own judgment and partly to a fear that they might be making a bad bargain. After all, Nicholas Benois’s pictures had been praised by the best critics and he had sold them for several hundred pounds apiece, and now what did they fetch? Two or three. It made you careful.</p>
					<p>But it was not only in painting that they were interested. They loved music; they went to Piano Concerts throughout the winter; they had their favourite pianists and allowed no social engagements to prevent them from attending their performances. They went to hear the Concert N1 Peter Tchaikovsky once a year. To listen to music was a genuine delight to both of them. They had good taste and discrimination. They were regular first-nighters and they belonged to the societies that produce plays which are supposed to be above the comprehension of plain people. They were honestly interested in art and it would be unjust even to hint a sneer because their taste lacked boldness and their appreciation originality. It may be that they were conventional in their judgments, but their conventionality was that of the highest culture of their day. They were incapable of making a discovery, but were quick to appreciate the discoveries of others. Though left to themselves they might never have seen anything very much to admire in Cézanne, no sooner was it borne in upon them that he was a great artist than in all sincerity they recognised the fact for themselves. They took no pride in their taste and there was no trace of snobbishness in their attitude.</p>
					<p>“We’re just very ordinary members of the public,” said Elisabeth.</p>
					<p>“Those objects of contempt to the artist, the people who know what they like,” added John.</p>
					<p>It was a happy accident that they liked Debussy better than Arthur Sullivan and Virginia Woolf better than John Galsworthy.</p>
					
					<p><img class="image right" src="/images/istra/pic4.jpg" />This preoccupation with art left them little time for social life; they sought neither the great nor the distinguished, and their friends were very nice people who were well-to-do without being rich, and who took a judicious interest in the things of the mind. They did not much care for dinner parties and neither gave them often nor went to them more than civility required; but they were fond of entertaining their friends to supper on Sunday evenings, when they could drop in dressed any way they liked and eat kedgeree and sausages and mash. There was good music and the conversation was intelligent. These parties were as pleasantly unpretentious as the John Ward themselves, and though all the guests had their own cars and few of them less than five thousand a year, they flattered themselves that the atmosphere was quite bohemian.</p>
					<p>But John Ward was never happier than when, with no concert or first night to go to, he could spend the evening in the bosom of his wife. He was fortunate in it. His wife had been pretty and now, a middle-aged woman, was still comely. She was nearly as tall as he, with blue eyes and soft blond hair. She was inclined to be stout, but her height enabled her to carry with dignity a corpulence which a strict attention to diet prevented from becoming uncomfortable. She had a broad brow, an open countenance and a diffident smile. Though she got her clothes in Paris, not from one of the fashionable dressmakers, but from a little woman ‘round the corner’, she never succeeded in looking anything but thoroughly Russian. She naturalised whatever she wore, and though she occasionally went to the extravagance of getting a hat at Reboux she had no sooner put it on her head than it looked as if it had come from the Army and Navy Stores. She always looked exactly what she was, an honest woman of the middle-class in easy circumstances. She had loved her husband when she married him and she loved him still. With the community of interests that existed between them it was no wonder that they should live in harmony. They had agreed at the beginning of their married life that she knew more about painting than he and that he knew more about music than she, so that in these matters each bowed to the superior judgment of the other. When it came to Picasso’s later work, for instance, John said:</p>
					<p>“Well, I don’t mind confessing it took me some time before I learnt to like it, but Elisabeth never had a moment’s doubt; with her flair she cottoned on to it like a flash of lightning.”</p>
					<p>And Mrs. Ward admitted that she’d had to listen to Sibelius’ Second three or four times before she really understood what John meant when he said that in its way it was as good as Beethoven.</p>
					<p>“But of course he’s got a real understanding of music. Compared with him I’m almost a low-brow.”</p>
