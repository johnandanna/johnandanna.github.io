					</header>
					<p>If you meet a member of that select club, “The Thirteen True Gardeners” entering the Vernon Hotel for the annual club dinner, you will observe, as he takes off his overcoat, that his evening coat has a strange … If (supposing that you have the star-defying audacity to address such a being) you ask him why, he will probably answer that he does it to avoid being mistaken for... You will then retire crushed. But you will leave behind you a mystery as yet unsolved and a tale worth telling.</p>
					<p><img class="image left" src="/images/istra/pic5.jpg" />If (to pursue the same vein of improbable conjecture) you were to meet a mild, hard-working little priest, named Father Brown, and were to ask him what he thought was the most singular luck of his life, he would probably reply that upon the whole his best stroke was at the Villa Rosemary, where he had averted a crime and, perhaps, saved a soul. He is perhaps a little proud of this wild and wonderful guess of his, and it is possible that he might refer to it. But since it is immeasurably unlikely that you will ever rise high enough in the social world to find “The Thirteen True Gardeners” or that you will ever sink low enough among slums and criminals to find Father Brown, I fear you will never hear the story at all unless you enjoy the Gala Diner to celebrate Birthdays of Sir John and Lady Ward at the historic Villa Rosemary on Friday 14th September 1918 at 7pm.</p>
					<p>The Vernon Hotel at which “The Thirteen True Gardeners” held their annual dinners was an institution such as can only exist in an oligarchical society which has almost gone mad on good manners. It was that topsy-turvy product—an “exclusive” commercial enterprise. That is, it was a thing which paid not by attracting people, but actually by turning people away. In the heart of a plutocracy tradesmen become cunning enough to be more fastidious than their customers. They positively create difficulties so that their wealthy and weary clients may spend money and diplomacy in overcoming them. If there were a fashionable hotel in London which no man could enter who was under six foot, society would meekly make up parties of six-foot men to dine in it. If there were an expensive restaurant which by a mere caprice of its proprietor was only open on Thursday afternoon, it would be crowded on Thursday afternoon.</p>
					<p>The Vernon Hotel stood, as if by accident, in the corner of a square in Belgravia. It was a small hotel; and a very inconvenient one. But its very inconveniences were considered as walls protecting a particular class. One inconvenience, in particular, was held to be of vital importance: the fact that practically only twenty-four people could dine in the place at once. The only big dinner table was the celebrated terrace table, which stood open to the air on a sort of veranda overlooking one of the most exquisite old gardens in London. Thus it happened that even the twenty-four seats at this table could only be enjoyed in warm weather; and this making the enjoyment yet more difficult made it yet more desired.</p>
					<p><img class="image right" src="/images/istra/pic6.jpg" />The existing owner of the hotel was a Jew named Lever; and he made nearly a million out of it, by making it difficult to get into. Of course he combined with this limitation in the scope of his enterprise the most careful polish in its performance. The wines and cooking were really as good as any in Europe, and the demeanour of the attendants exactly mirrored the fixed mood of the English upper class. The proprietor knew all his waiters like the fingers on his hand; there were only ten of them all told. It was much easier to become a Member of Parliament than to become a waiter in that hotel. Each waiter was trained in terrible silence and smoothness, as if he were a gentleman’s servant.</p>
					<p>The club of “The Thirteen True Gardeners” would not have consented to dine anywhere but in such a place, for it insisted on a luxurious privacy; and would have been quite upset by the mere thought that any other club was even dining in the same building. On the occasion of their annual dinner the Gardeners were in the habit of exposing all their treasures, as if they were in a private house. The society had a vast number of ceremonies and observances, but it had no history and no object; that was where it was so very aristocratic. You did not have to be anything in order to be one of the Thirteen Gardeners; unless you were already a certain sort of person, you never even heard of them. It had been in existence thirteen years. Its president was Mr. Audley. Its vice-president was the Duke of Chester.</p>
					<p>The Vernon Hotel at which “The Thirteen True Gardeners” held their annual dinners was not only an institution but The Place to save the important items of the True Gardeners.</p>
					<p>In July 14th 1918 everything from the Vernon Hotel has been devastated by a fire and “The Thirteen True Gardeners” had to find a new intimate place for their annual dinner and face a few vital issues for the first time in the history of the club..</p>
